\section*{Problem 1}

Regarding consumption note:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{food:} 
    \item \textbf{ndcons1:} 
    \item \textbf{ndcons2:} 
    \item \textbf{ndconsserv:} 
    \item \textbf{totcons:} 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 2}

\textbf{General explanation on how we deal with the data}

\textcolor{red}{Interviews take place in a quarter BUT consumption always refers to consumption in the 3 previous months, while income refers to the income in the last 12 months!} \\

\textbf{Specifications in Mace's paper (??) and our extensions}
There are basically two specifications that we want to test (both by Mace). Each of this will receive a subsection, in which we first re-estimate her results (as well as we possibly can, as we don't observe employment status). Then we usually expand on this specification by adding additional controls or extending the model otherwise. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Hypothesis 1: Individual Consumption depends only on Aggregate Spending}
What does the hypothesis expect? 

\textbf{2.1.A. Mace's specification}
In all coming specification we will always look at the same type of consumption (i.e. food, non-durables including education, non-durables excluding education, etc.) on the individual and aggregate levels.

Table \ref{tab:2.1A-deltacons} 
\input{PS2/reg_2.1A_cons}

\textbf{2.1.B. Our additional controls}

Table \ref{tab:2.1B-deltacons-net}
\input{PS2/regnet_2.1B_cons}

\textbf{2.1.C. Our additional controls (plus controlling for gross income changes instead of net income changes)}

Table \ref{tab:2.1B-deltacons-gross}
\input{PS2/reggr_2.1B_cons}

\textbf{2.1.D. We control for aggregate changes income (instead of aggregate changes in consumption)}

Idea here: Hypothesis 1 argues that individual consumption changes co-move one-to-one with the economy's average expenditure changes (and not with individual income changes). Besides proxying for changes in aggregate spending by changes in aggregate consumption (as we did before), we can proxy for it using changes in aggregate income. We do that below, controlling for changes in net/ gross individual income.

Table \ref{tab:2.1C-deltacons-net}
\input{PS2/reg_2.1C_cons}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Individual Consumption Growth depends only on Aggregate Consumption Growth}
What does the hypothesis expect? We would expect the coefficient on log.averagetotcons.change to be 1, and the coefficient on log.grossinc.change to be 0.

\textbf{2.2.A. Mace's specification}

Table \ref{tab:2.2A-logdeltacons}
\input{PS2/reg_2.2A_logcons}

\textbf{2.2.B. Our additional controls}

Table \ref{tab:log2.2B-deltacons-net}
\input{PS2/regnet_2.2B_logcons}

\textbf{2.2.C. Our additional controls (plus controlling for gross income changes instead of net income changes)}

Here, we regress individual HH's consumption growth rates (in its different specifications) in the past 9 months (time between the surveys) on the growth rate of aggregate consumption of that type, the growth rate of the HH's income and HH characteristics such as (age, HH size) and seasonal variation.
